# Node.js tutorial rest api

This is the code from section 24 of the Udemy Course [NodeJS - The Complete Guide (incl. MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-the-complete-guide/), Working with REST APIs. 

It creates simple get and post routes/controllers to send and receive data, as well as header and status information. 

A Postman API and a [Codepen REST API test app](https://codepen.io/AndrewJBateman/pen/dwbVaX?editors=0010) are used to send/receive data.
[Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) is the middleware used for uploading files. 
[socket.io](https://socket.io/) version 2.0 is added for real-time event-based communications
